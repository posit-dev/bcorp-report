# A Message from our CEO {.blue}

Posit endeavors to create free and open-source software for data
science, scientific research, and technical communication in a
sustainable way, because it benefits everyone when the essential tools
to produce and consume knowledge are available to all, regardless of
economic means.

We believe corporations should fulfill a purpose beneficial to the
public and be run for the benefit of all stakeholders including
employees, customers, and the community at large.

As a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) and a Certified B
Corporation®, Posit's open-source mission and commitment to a beneficial
public purpose are codified in our charter, requiring our corporate
decisions to balance the interests of community, customers, employees,
and shareholders.

B Corps^TM^ meet the highest verified standards of social and
environmental performance, transparency, and account- ability. Posit
measures its public benefit by utilizing the non-profit B Lab®'s "Impact
Assessment", a rigorous assessment of a company's impact on its workers,
customers, community, and environment.

In 2019, Posit (then RStudio) met the B Corporation certification
requirements set by the B Lab. In 2023, our certification was renewed,
and we are proud to share that our B Lab Impact Assessment score rose
from 86.1 to 92.5 with this renewal. The B Lab certification process
uses credible, comprehensive, transparent,and independent standards of
social and environmental performance. Details of these assessments can
be found at \[web link\].

As a PBC, Posit publishes a report at least once every two years that
describes the public benefit we have created, along with how we seek to
provide public benefits in the future. This is the fourth of these
reports. Previous published reports are available at \[here\].

To fulfill its beneficial purposes, Posit intends to remain an
independent company over the long term. With the support of our
customers, employees, and the community, we remain excited to contribute
useful solutions to the important problems of knowledge they face.

# Introduction 

Posit's mission is to create free and open-source software for data
science, scientific research, and technical communication. We do this to
enhance the production and consumption of knowledge by everyone,
regardless of economic means, and to facilitate collaboration and
reproducible research, both of which are critical to the integrity and
efficacy of work in science, education, government, and industry.

In addition to our open source products, Posit produces a modular
platform of commercial software products that enable teams to adopt R,
Python, and other open-source data science software at scale, along with
online services to make it easier to learn and use them over the web.

Together, Posit\'s open-source software and commercial software form a
virtuous cycle. In most companies, a \"customer\" is someone who pays
you. For us, the definition of a customer must include the open source
community, with whom we exchange the currencies of attention, respect,
and love. When we deliver value to our open source users, they are
likely to bring our software into their professional environments, which
opens up the possibility of commercial partnerships. To keep this cycle
flowing, our open source developers have to know and care about the
integrations with proprietary solutions that matter to our enterprise
customers. It also means that Posit\'s commercial teams need to
consistently provide value to individuals who may never spend a dollar
with us directly.

Posit's approach is not typical. Traditionally, scientific and technical
computing companies created exclusively proprietary software. While it
can provide a robust foundation for investing in product development,
proprietary software can also create excessive dependency that is not
good for data science practitioners and the community. In contrast,
Posit provides core productivity tools, packages, protocols, and file
formats as open-source software so that customers aren't overly
dependent on a single software vendor. Additionally, while our
commercial products enhance the development and use of our open-source
software, they are not fundamentally required for those without the need
or the ability to pay for them.

In 2023, Posit spent [\[33%?\]]{.mark} of its engineering resources on
open-source software development, and led contributions to over
[\[xx\]]{.mark} open-source projects. Posit-led projects targeted a
broad range of areas including the RStudio IDE; infrastructure libraries
for R and Python; numerous packages and tools to streamline data
manipulation, exploration and visualization, modeling, and machine
learning; and integration with external data sources. Posit also
sponsors or contributes to many open-source and community projects led
by others, including NumFOCUS, the R Consortium, the Python Software
Foundation, DuckDB, Pandoc, pyodide, and prose mirror, as well as dozens
of smaller projects via the Open Source Collective or directly on
Github. Additional information about our products and company
contributions for the past two years can be found in our \"Year In
Review\'\' blog posts. \[available here\].

Today, millions of people download and use Posit open-source products in
their daily lives. Additionally, more than [\[how many paying
customers?\]]{.mark} organizations that purchase our professional
products help us sustain and grow our mission. It is an inspiration to
consider that we are helping many participate in global economies that
increasingly reward data literacy, and that our tools help produce
insights essential to navigating our complex world.
