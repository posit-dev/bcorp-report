Posit's mission is to create free and open-source software for data
science, scientific research, and technical communication. We do this to
enhance the production and consumption of knowledge by everyone,
regardless of economic means, and to facilitate collaboration and
reproducible research, both of which are critical to the integrity and
efficacy of work in science, education, government, and industry.

In addition to our open source products, Posit produces a modular
platform of commercial software products that enable teams to adopt R,
Python, and other open-source data science software at scale. Posit also
offers online services that make it easier to learn and use data science
tools over the web.

Together, Posit's open-source software and commercial software form a
virtuous cycle. In most companies, a "customer" is someone who pays
you. For us, the definition of a customer must include the open source
community, with whom we exchange the currencies of attention, respect,
and love. When we deliver value to our open source users, they will
likely bring our software into their professional environments, which
opens up the possibility of commercial partnerships. To keep this cycle
flowing, our open source developers must know and care about the
integrations with proprietary solutions that matter to our enterprise
customers. {{< colbreak >}} It also means that Posit's commercial teams consistently
provide value to individuals who may never directly spend a dollar with
us.

Posit's approach is not typical. Traditionally, scientific and technical
computing companies create exclusively proprietary software. While it
can provide a robust foundation for investing in product development,
proprietary software can also create excessive dependency that is not
good for data science practitioners and the community. In contrast,
Posit provides core productivity tools, packages, protocols, and file
formats as open-source software so customers aren't overly dependent on
a single software vendor. Additionally, while our commercial products
enhance the development and use of our open-source software, they are
not fundamentally required for those without the need or the ability to
pay for them.

As of May 2024, Posit is spending \~38% of its engineering resources on
open-source software development, and is leading contributions to over
350 open-source projects. Posit-led projects targeted a
broad range of areas including the RStudio IDE; infrastructure libraries
for R and Python; numerous packages and tools to streamline data
manipulation, exploration and visualization, modeling, and machine
learning; and integration with external data sources. Posit also
sponsors or contributes to many open-source and community projects led
by others, including NumFOCUS, the R Consortium, the Python Software
Foundation, DuckDB, Pandoc, pyodide, and ProseMirror, as well as dozens
of smaller projects via the Open Source Collective or directly on
Github. Additional information about our products and company
contributions for the past two years can be found in our ["Year In
Review" blog

Today, millions of people download and use Posit open-source products in
their daily lives. Additionally, more than 10,000 customers that
purchase our professional products help us sustain and grow our mission.
It is inspiring to help so many people participate in global economies
that increasingly reward data literacy, and know that our tools help
produce insights essential to navigating our complex world.
