Posit aims to create free and open-source software for data science,
scientific research, and technical communication in a sustainable way,
because it benefits everyone when the essential tools to produce and
consume knowledge are available to all, regardless of economic means.

We believe corporations should fulfill a purposeful benefit to the
public and be run for the benefit of all stakeholders including
employees, customers, and the larger community.

As a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) and a Certified B
Corporation®, Posit's open-source mission and commitment to a beneficial
public purpose are codified in our charter, requiring our corporate
decisions to balance the interests of the community, customers,
employees, and shareholders.

B Corps^TM^ meet the highest verified standards of social and
environmental performance, transparency, and accountability. Posit
measures its public benefit by utilizing the non-profit B Lab®'s "Impact
Assessment", a rigorous assessment of a company's impact on its workers,
customers, community, and environment.

In 2019, Posit (then RStudio) met the B Corporation certification
requirements set by the B Lab. In 2023, our certification was renewed,
and we are proud to share that our B Lab Impact Assessment score rose
from 86.1 to 92.5 with this renewal. The B Lab certification process
uses credible, comprehensive, transparent, and independent standards to
measure social and environmental performance. Details of these
assessments can be found on our [B Lab company
page](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/company/rstudio/).

To fulfill its beneficial purposes, Posit intends to remain an
independent company over the long term. With the support of our
customers, employees, and the community, we remain excited to contribute
useful solutions to the important problems of knowledge they face.
