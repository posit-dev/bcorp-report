The BLab Impact Assessment is composed of questions in five Impact
Areas: Governance, Workers, Community, Environment, and Customers.
Posit's assessment results are available to the public
[here](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/company/rstudio/).
We completed our first Impact Assessment in 2019 and earned an overall
score of **86.1.** We are proud to report that our latest score from our
recertification process in 2023, is **92.5**. To put this in context,
the threshold for B Lab certification is a score of 80 or higher, and
the median score for ordinary businesses who take the assessment is
50.9. Posit seeks to continually improve our internal governance,
increase our workforce diversity and employee development efforts,
expand our stewardship of the environment, deepen our engagement in our
communities, and better serve our customers so that our public benefit
will continue to improve each year.

In our initial assessment, we received high marks for incorporating as a
benefit corporation, the health, wellness, safety, and financial
security of our employees, and for educating and serving customers. We
identified formal goal setting, career development, diversity, equity &
inclusion, civic engagement & giving, and air & climate as areas for
improvement.
